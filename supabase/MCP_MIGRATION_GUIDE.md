# Using the Supabase MCP Server for Migration

Your environment is already configured with the Supabase MCP server, which provides a direct way to interact with your Supabase project without relying on the CLI.

## What is the MCP Server?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Supabase allows direct interaction with your Supabase project through API calls, bypassing the need for the Supabase CLI.

## Migration Steps Using MCP

### 1. Read the Migration Files

First, let's read the contents of our migration files:

- `20240101000001_create_core_schema.sql`
- `20240101000002_create_service_reports_schema.sql`
- `20240101000003_create_rls_policies.sql`
- `20240101000004_seed_lookup_data.sql`

### 2. Execute the Migrations

Using the MCP server, we can execute SQL directly on your Supabase project. The process would be:

1. Execute the core schema migration
2. Execute the service reports schema migration
3. Execute the RLS policies migration
4. Execute the seed data migration

### 3. Verification

After executing the migrations, we can verify the results by checking if the tables were created correctly.

## Advantages of Using MCP

1. **No CLI installation required**
2. **No connection issues** - Uses API instead of direct database connection
3. **Faster execution** - Direct API calls
4. **Better error handling** - Clear error messages from API responses

## How to Use the MCP Server

The MCP server is already configured in your `.kilocode/mcp.json` file. To use it for migration:

1. The server will be available when you start your development environment
2. You can interact with it through the available MCP tools
3. Execute SQL commands directly against your Supabase project

## Next Steps

To proceed with the migration using the MCP server:

1. Let me know you're ready to execute the migrations
2. I'll read each migration file and execute them in sequence
3. We'll verify the results after each step

This approach should bypass all the CLI issues we encountered earlier and provide a more reliable migration process.
